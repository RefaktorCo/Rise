<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Rise is a beautiful multi purpose one page parallax responsive template perfectly tailored for creative professionals or agencies. For theme support that cannot be found in this documentation, please visit our <a href="http://refaktorthemes.com/support"> support forum</a>. 
<p>Updated: 04/26/14<br>Author: <a href="http://refaktorthemes.com" target="_blank">Refaktor</a><br>Docs powered by: <a href="https://github.com/jgallen23/toc" target="_blank">TOC</a><br>Original design by <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/codeblvck" target="_blank">

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>There are two ways Rise can be installed. For existing sites that already have content, the first method will only involve the installation and activation of the theme. The second option includes a full Drupal 7 install with the same SQL database file used to create the theme demo. Please choose which installation method works best for you and follow the instructions. We do highly recommend you perform the full install if you are new to Drupal or don't have any existing content you need to work with.
<h3>Theme Only</h3>
Option 1:
<ul>
  <li>Visit yourdomain.com/admin/appearance/install</li>
  <li>Upload the Rise.zip file found inside the /theme folder in the download files</li>
  <li>Enable and set to default</li>
</ul>
Option 2:
<ul>
  <li>Extract the Rise.zip file and upload the Rise folder via FTP to /sites/all/themes</li>
  <li>Visit yourdomain.com/admin/appearance/</li>
  <li>Scroll down to "DISABLED THEMES" and set and enable Rise</li>
</ul>

<h3>Full Drupal Install</h3>
<p>The following steps are designed for people that have experience manually installing Drupal and importing databases. If you do not feel comfortable performing these steps yourself, contact your server administrator for help. <strong>NOTE</strong> this option is for a completely new Drupal install. Do not import the provided SQL file into an existing Drupal database or you will lose all of your data!</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a database for this installation of Drupal and import the SQL file that came with the theme.</li>
<li>Follow <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/install/settings-file" target="_blank"> these directions</a> to create the settings.php file. Save this file somewhere so you can copy it over to the Drupal installation we have provided.</li>
<li>Copy the entire contents of the /demo/Ebor folder to the location on your web server where you want your site to be accessed. If you want your primary domain to point to your install of Ebor, copy everything to the root folder. If you want your site to be accessed as a subsection of your domain (for example: yourdomain.com/drupal) then simply rename the /demo/Ebor folder to the desired name and upload to the root of your server. Also be sure to copy over the settings.php file mentioned in the previous step</li>
<li>Login to your site with the username <strong>admin</strong> and the password <strong>admin</strong> and visit /admin/people to change the admin username and password.</li>
<li>Go through the Drupal configuration found in /admin/config options and update all the necessary information to reflect your website. Also be sure to visit /admin/config/media/file-system and change the Temporary Directory.</li>

</ol>
<h2>Ebor Sub-Theme</h2>

<p>Ebor comes with a shell sub-theme called Ebor_sub that you can use to make customizations to the style and template structure of the parent theme without having to modify the parent theme itself. This is useful if you plan on updating the parent theme as we release updates on ThemeForest. If you performed the full install you will already see Ebor_sub in the list of themes available. If you did the standalone install you can find the Ebor_sub.zip file in the root of the download files and you can install it like any other theme.</p>
<p>There is an empty stylesheet already defined which is /css/custom.css (inside the Ebor_sub folder). Use this file to add all of the custom CSS that you plan on using. You can also copy any template file from the /Ebor/templates folder into the /Ebor_sub/templates folder and it will listen to the sub-themes template file first. This will allow you to update the parent theme as we make updates without losing your customizations. Just pay attention to the changelog and compare the parent theme files with yours and make any adjustments as needed.</p>
<p>You will need to configure the sub-themes theme settings separately from the parent theme's, so visit /admin/appearance/settings/Ebor_sub to configure the theme settings for the sub-theme. You also need to configure the block regions separately.</p>
</ol>  
<h2>Menu</h2>
<p>Ebor has a block region called Site Navigation which can be used to add any menu block you like. The demo simply uses the default Main Menu block but you can create a custom menu block if you like.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure to check the "show as expanded" box on all parent items with children to ensure the dropdown menu works correctly.</p>


<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>Below are the modules required to fully utilize the theme:</p>

<h4>General Required Modules</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/ctools">Chaos Tools</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a></li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/project/exclude_node_title">Exclude Node Title</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ebor Social</h3>
<p>Ebor Social is a simple module that allows you to display social icon links in a block. Once installed the module can be configured via /admin/config/ebor_social and the "Ebor Social" block can be added to any region via /admin/structure/block</p>
<p>A copy of the module can be found in the /assets folder in the ThemeForest download files and is also included in the full install.</p>

<h3>Ebor Custom Content</h3>
<p>If you used the "theme only" option to install the theme on an existing install that already has content we recommend you use our Ebor Custom Content module to create the additional content types, fields and Views needed to fully utilize the theme. You will find it in the /assets folder in the download files. This module is a custom <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features" target="_blank">Features</a> module and will not run without it. We recommend copying all of the modules from the /drupal_7/sites/all/modules folder into your install if you do not already have them. After you have all the modules simply upload and activate the Ebor Custom Content module and the content types, fields and views will automatically be created.</p>

<h2>Mega Slider</h2>
<p>Ebor includes the Drupal <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/mega-slider/4313171" target="_blank">Mega Slider</a> module. This module offers an incredible number of options to create the exact slider to meet your needs. To begin configuring your slider visit /admin/structure/md-slider and press the "add new slider" link. You can find documentation for the slider inside the md_slider module folder and you can reference the video below.</p>
